VeemUI
Components for SvelteKit

VeemUI is a collection of components being developed for SvelteKit by Veem Digital. This project is still in its early stages and is not yet ready for production use. However, it aims to provide a modular and dynamic UI toolkit, with a focus on smooth animations and modern, creative designs to help you build visually stunning websites, including those optimized for Awwwards-worthy websites.
Vision

At Veem Digital, we aim to empower web developers with high-performance UI components that combine elegant design and robust functionality. Our goal is to create a seamless, visually rich experience that helps you deliver award-winning websites. Over time, we plan to release a version that is compatible with both GSAP Pro and GSAP Free, providing more flexibility for developers using different animation libraries.
